## README

The directory contains a general template that I use to get started with a new obsidian vault. Please note that this is a highly opinionated vault that I personally find efficient for the way I way. The vault essentially takes some of the concepts of Knowledge Graphs to be able to organise my thought process. 

Please feel free to make any changes or suggest and PR changes.
