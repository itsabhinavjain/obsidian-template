		- #status/todo : What needs to be done on priority 
		- #status/in-progress : What you are currently actively working on 
		- #status/done : Should be essentially used when an output is generated and you need a list of items
		- #status/waiting : Waiting for another task or person to give an input  
		- #status/sort : Still to sort this out at a later point in time
	- Type tags - #type
